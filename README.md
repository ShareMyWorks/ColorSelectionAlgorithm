# ColorSelectionAlgorithm
To solve such problem : Take M balls from N colors and list all combinations.

NOTEï¼šThe total amount of combinations equals (N - 1) combinations of (M + N - 1). The result will be a HUGE NUMBER when M and N are greater than 10. And this may lead unknown consequences on some devices.
